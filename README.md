# PV Statistics Tracker
App designed for PV users, who are interested how their investment is doing. My second Rest Framework and ReactJS project. 

## Things that are working

- Calculation of basics stuff (autoconsumption, consumption, balance)
- Adding and editing posts (deleting coming soon)

## Things to be done

- User settings page
- User authentication, and user based posts
- Nicer looking login and register page
